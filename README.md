# Simple Pacman-Inspired Game

## About

As the title states, this is a simple Pacman-inspired game that showcases the programming skills I have gained from my CS classes. It includes, but is not limited to, **Collision Detection/Collision Fixing**,
Object Oriented design principles like **polymorphism** and **inheritance**, **MVC Architecture**, **Lazy Loading**, **etc.**

## How to Run

No build tools were used, so you can simply 'javac *.java' and 'java Game' to run the program. 

However, I have a 'build.bat' file that can compile and run the game very simply for you.
